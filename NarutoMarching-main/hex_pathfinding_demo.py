"""hex_pathfinding_demo.py
Interactive A* pathfinding demo on the Naruto hex marching map.
Reference: https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/

Day-by-day resource system:
  - Day 1 starts with 800 food and 6 steps
  - Each following day: +1600 food, +6 steps (max 18 steps at day start)
  - Unused resources roll to next day
  - If move exceeds available food or steps, it happens next day

Controls
--------
  Click hexes to extend the path. Each segment costs food (based on terrain)
  and steps (counted as new hexes visited). Steps don't count revisits.
  
  [Undo Last]  – remove the previous move
  [Reset Path] – return to origin, clear all stats
